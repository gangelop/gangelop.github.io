##  System Administrator
**LOCATION:** remote - home office  
**PERIOD:** November 2011 - April 2013 and February 2014 - January 2015 *(2 yrs 6 mos)*

### Responsibilities
I worked for a series of video on demand websites as a system administrator. My day to day responsibilities revolved around Linux system administration. 

My main responsibilities were:

In addition to day-to-day tasks, I planned and implemented a migration from an old performance graphing system (cacti) to a more flexible modern stack (graphite, grafana, statsd, logstash, collectd) for the entire infrastructure. (I don't know how mature prometheus was in 2014 but if it was and I was aware of it, I would have used it!)
