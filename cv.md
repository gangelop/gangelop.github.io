**period:** September 2022 - December 2022 *(4 months)*

At Canonical I was hired to be part of the newly formed Desktop Support Group.

At Red Hat I worked as part of the customer support team for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. I initially specialized in filesystem and storage and later in kernel related issues.  
My main responsibilities were:
* Solving technical issues for customers running RHEL such as kernel panics, out of memory events, performance issues, filesystem corruptions, lvm corruptions, storage disconnections (NAS, SAN).

* Communicating with customers over e-mail and phone.
* Contributing to Red Hat's Knowledge-Centered Service (KCS) knowledgebase.

    * Basic vmcore analysis and identifying common causes of kernel panics.
    * git usage.
    * Advanced usage of vim and command line tools such as zsh, fzf, ctrl-p, tmux, for parsing sosreport and similar data.

    * KCS coaching.

# Video Sites ⋅ System Administrator
**location:** remote - home office  
**period:** November 2011 - April 2013 and February 2014 - January 2015 *(2 years 6 months)*

* Setting up development environments for newly hired developers.
* Provisioning and maintaining internal services for developers (e.g. internally-hosted GitLab).
* Participating in an on-call rotation responding to monitoring alerts for production systems.

In addition to day-to-day tasks, I planned and implemented a migration from an old performance graphing system (cacti) to a more flexible modern stack (graphite, grafana, statsd, logstash, collectd) for the entire infrastructure. (I don't know how mature prometheus was in 2014 but if it was and I was aware of it, I would have used it!)
