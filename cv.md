### Responsibilities
I worked for a series of video hosting and video on demand websites as a system administrator. My day to day responsibilities revolved around Linux system administration. 

The following were my main responsibilities:

(I don't know how mature prometheus was in 2014 but if it was and I was aware of it, I would have used it!)
