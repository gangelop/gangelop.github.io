Following the very recent announcement of the <a title="Steam Machines!" href="http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamMachines/" target="_blank">steam machines</a>, I went to apply for the hardware beta. There was some legal agreement which I would normally ignore and check the "I agree button." But this time I didn't. This time I read it. And there it was:

> 1. Valve Corporation (&#8220;Valve&#8221;, &#8220;We&#8221;, &#8220;Us&#8221; or &#8220;Our&#8221;) has developed and produced prototypes of entertainment system hardware and software, including a set-top box running custom software and **A GAME CONTROLLER** (collectively: &#8220;Beta Products&#8221;). These Beta Products are currently being prepared for a limited beta testing program (&#8220;Beta Program&#8221;) involving select end users of Our online service known as Steam (&#8220;Steam&#8221;).
