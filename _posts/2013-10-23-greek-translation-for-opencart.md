![Greek translation for opencart]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/greek-icon.png)

I&#8217;ve been busy lately, setting up a project with <a href="http://opencart.com/" target="_blank">OpenCart</a>. Since this is a website for a local store, it has to be in Greek. Unfortunately, all the Greek translations were out of date. Fortunately, this is open source! I&#8217;m happy to announce, I&#8217;ve taken one of the out-of-date translations, spent some time on it, given it <a href="https://github.com/lathan/opencart-greek" target="_blank">a proper github repo</a>, and <a href="http://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=extension/extension/info&extension_id=14317&filter_search=greek" target="_blank">brought it up to date</a>.  
If I end up using OpenCart with this project and the project itself survives, you should expect this translation to be kept up-to-date.
