Here&#8217;s a little API I put together for personal use. I thought other people might find it useful so here it is! Do as many requests as you like (within reason&#8230;). I&#8217;ll try to make sure it stays up but I don&#8217;t guarantee anything.

`<a title="ip" href="/api/ip" target="_blank">/api/ip</a>`  
Returns your ip address.

`<a title="user agent" href="/api/agent" target="_blank">/api/agent</a>`  
Returns your browser&#8217;s user agent.

Below are some similar services, run by other people. They&#8217;re all pretty cool, you should check them out!
